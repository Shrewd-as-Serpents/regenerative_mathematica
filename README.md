what is needed: emergent ontological equivalence 

The foundational problem lies in binary arithmetic's inherent inability to represent many common fractions exactly. IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic forces all numerical data into a binary state, creating cumulative precision errors that compound exponentially over time. 

When storing 3/2 as 1.5 in decimal notation, the binary conversion to 32-bit floating-point representation introduces systematic truncation errors that manifest as 1.0999999046325684
demonstrating binary systems fundamentally distort mathematical reality

precision failures become catastrophic at scale. Consider: 4K texture containing 33,177,600 pixels: even a seemingly negligible 0.0001% error per pixel results in *3,317 corrupted pixels per frame*. 
In real-time applications processing 60 frames per second, this translates to nearly 200,000 corrupted pixels per second; digital entropy that accumulates into system-wide degradation.

Intel's Management Engine (ME) and similar firmware technologies represent sophisticated forms of digital colonialism, deliberately preventing hardware repurposing and forcing premature obsolescence. 2012 Intel i5 processor possesses sufficient computational power to run Ubuntu Linux for decades, yet artificial barriers like Windows 11's TPM 2.0 requirements force functional hardware into electronic waste streams.

Planned obsolescence operates through multiple vectors: hardware designed for non-repairable disassembly, software updates that deliberately slow devices, and artificial incompatibilities between operating systems and applications. 

This linear life"cycle" (end-point) transforms functional technology into environmental poison: generating over 50 million tons of electronic waste annually.

Binary oppositions resolve through environmental context, this suggests:

System boundaries are permeable rather than fixed
incomplete logical mappings create excess heat, this is perhaps hidden logic: abstractions that ignore environmental embedding

Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican peoples developed sophisticated mathematical systems that offer profound alternatives to binary computing's limitations. The Maya vigesimal (base-20) system represents a fundamentally different approach to numerical representation that eliminates many of binary computing's inherent problems.

Maya mathematics employed non-power positional systems with multipliers of 1, 20, 18×20, and 18×20^n
creating: representational redundancy enhancing (instead hinder) mathematical operations. Non-binary flexibility allows the same number to be written in multiple valid ways: providing built-in error correction and computational robustness that binary systems cannot achieve. These emergent equivalencies aren’t possible in strictly binary settings, because no “equivalent” forms exist—only “the” form.

2024 research in Quanta Magazine shows base-3 has the lowest "radix economy" of any integer base, and mathematically optimal computing approaches e (~2.718), which is much closer to 3 than 2. A ternary stream with N=12 has 531,441 values versus binary's 4,096.

### Binary reduction 
builds rigidity by forcing every value into a unique, singular representation. In doing so, it stores redundant bits to enforce this uniqueness. this redundancy is inflexible: it doesn’t enhance the system’s resilience or meaning, it just pads the data. In contrast, ternary, vigesimal, and harmonic/paired-integer systems allow for multiple valid ways to represent the same value and is inherently resistant to the precision degradation that plagues IEEE 754 arithmetic.

This “representational redundancy” provides:
Intrinsic error correction. if one symbol is corrupted, other representations may still resolve to the correct value.

Flexibility and robustness. there’s more than one path to truth, so the system is less brittle, less prone to catastrophic error propagation.

Emergent properties and ontological equivalence: because the system is not artificially restricted to a singular form, relationships and patterns can arise between different representations, which can themselves carry meaning or utility.

The Maya Long Count calendar demonstrates this principle in practice. Unlike binary systems that force singular representations, Maya mathematics embraced multiple valid representations of the same quantity.

The Mesoamerican discovery of *zero* emerged from familiarity with multiple representation systems rather than abstract mathematical necessity. 
This conceptual approach treats zero not as absence but as a *mathematical operator* that enables precise calculations without the truncation errors inherent in binary floating-point systems.

In base-20 computing architectures, the fraction 3/2 remains exactly 3:2 when stored as paired integers, eliminating the precision loss that occurs in binary conversion. This approach to exact rational arithmetic prevents the accumulative errors that degrade binary computations over time.

Ternary, vigesimal, and paired integer systems can encode the same information in fewer digits (more state per symbol). For example, 20 binary digits ≈ 13 ternary digits. Using alternative arithmetic and information systems (like harmonic primes or paired integers) might reduce effective entropy or allow lossless representation of certain structures and relationships.

Prime/harmonic ratios: Storing values like 3/2 in binary always produces recurring representations or truncation; paired integer or rational encodings can preserve structure and relationships (essential for exact modeling, linguistic or algorithmic).

RISC-V processor architectures combined with FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) systems provide the hardware foundation for implementing base-20 computing paradigms. open-source architectures to escape proprietary constraints associated with planned obsolescence, while offering unprecedented flexibility for representing and implimenting diverse logical systems

The transition to Indigenous mathematical computing embodies repair of fundamental relationships to resources, time, and knowledge production. While colonial computing treats the Earth as a resource extraction site, Indigenous computing paradigms recognize technological development as reciprocal relationship with natural systems.

Base-20 computing aligned with 260Hz resonance cycles (Earth's rotation divided by 86,400 seconds, multiplied by Maya Lamat cycles) creates rhythms synchronized to environmental and planetary systems rather than imposed upon them.
computing can grow from an extractive industry into regenerative practice to enhance rather than degrade ecology, reciprocity, and the interdependent nature of "personal" growth. 

The mathematical precision enabled by exact rational arithmetic eliminates the entropy accumulation that characterizes binary systems, creating computing architectures capable of operating indefinitely without precision degradation. Combined with FPGA upgradeability and sustainable power systems, these technologies offer genuine alternatives to the environmental destruction inherent in colonial computing paradigms.

Analogy:
Musical harmony (e.g., 3:2 ratio) is best represented with paired/multiple-value logic, not as a forced float approximation. Only the former captures the resonance and ontological depth; the latter only tracks a shadow.

For polysynthetic language translation, using richer numeric systems than binary may be the *only way to ensure actual complexity is represented and solvable*


Ternary/harmonic/Indigenous math offers not only computational resilience but ontological depth, flexibility, and emergent meaning : equivalent representations are allowed and inherent, not forbidden.

Binary constrains redundancy to error, dismissing the possibility of emergence and true environmental and systemic robustness.

Key Points:

Preservation of all meaning:
Conventional systems optimize for relevance and efficiency; they translate only what is "useful," disregarding the environmental, structural, and emergent context: *masking true complexity and discarding vast unrepresented information.*

Floating-point errors and binary logic cause mathematical and computational systems to hide or collapse the full multidimensional structure; this is expressed as both *entropy* and *heat* in computational terms, and as loss of environmental and emergent meaning in logic systems.

### "all_meaning" as the fundamental abstraction?

if logic and computation aimed to preserve "all_meaning" systems would necessarily require compositional, recursive, and environment-embedded models (not just relevance-filtered logic).

Numeric bases and algorithms must be capable of retaining every morphemic, semantic, and environmental relationship as a complete state of emergent complexity but backbloomed smallified: a seed (kernels are for eating)

Relevance-driven logic is lossy:
Western logic and computation treat the environment and "excess" relations as disposable.

logic executes the target then filters all else. What is discarded is not trivial; it is precisely the complexity and meaning we seek to capture, instead masked or destroyed by the limitations of representation iself. This philosophical problem represented as a creative linguistic expression does not negate the direct relevancy to physics and mathematics: these are "factors", sharing more qualities across "disciplines" than the discipline to ignore all but the target entity and reduce it to an object, calling multidimentional reducion "linear" logic should be a clue to the true size of this recursively destructive issue. 

Attempting to force a paradigm shift from relevance-filtered "execution" to total environmental, semantic, and structural representation requires modeling systems as emergent, recursive, and whole: input-output matches do not suffice.
mathematics and programming languages need to model systems as emergent, recursive, and whole, not just as input-output machines.
floating-point/binary math acts as a veil over ontology, semantics, and context: some problems are much less complex, some much more.

binary systems trying to discretize continuous reality while claiming precision are just failing at absolute representations of infinity and truncating as "close-enough"

energy efficiency tidbits and explorations

proofs needed:
RISC-V embedded systems typically consume 5 watts while delivering 20 GOPS performance, achieving 4.0 GOPS per watt efficiency
this is dramatically superior to x86 desktop systems that achieve 333 performance units per kWh over an abbreviated 3-year lifecycles.
When extended over a 10-year lifespan, these systems deliver 4,000 performance units per kWh consumed

FPGA architectures enhance this efficiency through reconfigurable computing that adapts hardware to specific computational tasks. A base-20 FPGA implementation could theoretically achieve 6.0 GOPS per watt while extending operational lifespans to 50 years through continuous hardware updates and reconfigs
